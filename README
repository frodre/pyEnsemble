PyEnsemble v0.8

***************************************
*  DESCRIPTION
***************************************

    PyEnsemble is  a set of Python scripts used to manage an ensemble of GEOS-Chem
  or GEOS-Chem Adjoint model runs.


***************************************
*  REQUIREMENTS
***************************************

  - Python v2.5 or greater.
  - MPI and associated library paths setup
  - GCC compiler

***************************************
*  INSTALLATION
***************************************

     PyEnsemble relies on the numpy and mpi4py libraries to run.  If the current
  system python version includes those libraries, no installation is necessary.
  Just move pyEnsemble to the desired directory and the scripts should be able to
  run.

     If problems are encountered when using the system python libraries or if 
  getting mpi4py and numpy installed on the system is not possible, included is
  a python virtual environment which uses the system version of python and installs
  the required libraries locally.  To setup this virtual environment, the paths 
  to all MPI libraries, Python, and GCC compiler must be set.  On cluster computing
  systems usually these are setup by default or a user is required to load the correct 
  modules/dotkits.  Consult system documentation, or administrators if you are unsure
  about this requirement.
